         <p>Born in Nebraska, while an infant Malcolm 
            moved with his family to <a heref="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lansing-Michigan">Lansing</a>, Michigan. 
            When Malcolm was six years old, his father, 
            the Rev. Earl Little, a Baptist minister and 
            former supporter of the early Black 
            nationalist leader <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>, died 
            after being hit by a streetcar, quite 
            possibly the victim of murder by whites. 
            The surviving family was so poor that Malcolm's 
            mother, Louise Little, resorted to cooking 
            dandelion greens from the street to feed her 
            children. After she was committed to an insane 
            <a data-term="asylum" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/asylum">asylum</a> in 1939, Malcolm and his siblings were 
            sent to foster homes or to live with family 
            members.</p>
            
            <p>Malcolm excelled in school, but after 
            one of his eighth-grade teachers told 
            him that he should become a carpenter 
            instead of a lawyer, he lost interest 
            and soon ended his formal education. 
            As a rebellious youngster, Malcolm 
            moved from the Michigan State Detention 
            Home, a juvenile home in Mason, Michigan, 
            to the Roxbury section of Boston to live 
            with an older half sister, Ella, from 
            his father’s first marriage. There he 
            became involved in petty criminal 
            activities in his teenage years. 
            Known as “Detroit Red” for the reddish 
            tinge in his hair, he developed into a 
            street hustler, drug dealer, and leader 
            of a gang of thieves in 
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Roxbury-Massachusetts">Roxbury</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Harlem-New-York">Harlem</a>
            min (in New York City).</p>
            
            <p>While in prison for robbery from 1946 to 1952, 
               he underwent a conversion that eventually 
               led him to join the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nation-of-Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, 
               an African American movement that combined 
               elements of Islam with Black <a data-term="nationalism" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism">nationalism</a>. 
               His decision to join the Nation also was 
               influenced by discussions with his brother Reginald, 
               who had become a member in Detroit and who was 
               incarcerated with Malcolm in the Norfolk Prison 
               Colony in Massachusetts in 1948. Malcolm quit 
               smoking and gambling and refused to eat pork 
               in keeping with the Nation’s dietary restrictions. 
               In order to educate himself, he spent long hours 
               reading books in the prison library, even memorizing 
               a dictionary. He also sharpened his <a data-term="forensic" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forensic">forensic</a> skills 
               by participating in debate classes. Following Nation 
               tradition, he replaced his surname, “Little,” with an 
               “X,” a custom among Nation of Islam followers who 
               considered their family names to have originated 
               with white slaveholders.</p>

               <h2>Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam</h2>
               <p>After his release from prison Malcolm 
                  helped to lead the Nation of Islam 
                  during the period of its greatest growth 
                  and influence. He met <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elijah-Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a> 
                  in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Chicago">Chicago</a> 
                  in 1952 and then began organizing 
                  temples for the Nation in New York, Philadelphia, 
                  and Boston and in cities in the South. 
                  He founded the Nation’s newspaper, Muhammad 
                  Speaks, which he printed in the basement 
                  of his home, and initiated the practice of 
                  requiring every male member of the Nation 
                  to sell an assigned number of newspapers on 
                  the street as a recruiting and fund-raising 
                  technique. He also articulated the Nation’s 
                  racial doctrines on the <a data-term="inherent" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inherent">inherent</a> 
                  evil of whites and the natural superiority of Blacks.</p>

                  <p>Malcolm rose rapidly to become the minister 
                     of Boston Temple No. 11, which he founded; 
                     he was later rewarded with the post of minister 
                     of Temple No. 7 in Harlem, the largest and 
                     most prestigious temple in the Nation after 
                     the Chicago headquarters. Recognizing his 
                     talent and ability, Elijah Muhammad, who had 
                     a special affection for Malcolm, named him 
                     the National Representative of the Nation of 
                     Islam, second in rank to Muhammad himself. 
                     Under Malcolm’s lieutenancy, the Nation 
                     claimed a membership of 500,000. The actual 
                     number of members fluctuated, however, and 
                     the influence of the organization, refracted 
                     through the public persona of Malcolm X, 
                     always greatly exceeded its size.</p>

                     <p>An <a data-term="articulate" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/articulate">articulate</a> 
                        public speaker, a <a data-term="charismatic" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charismatic">charismatic</a> 
                        personality, and an <a data-term="indefatigable" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indefatigable">indefatigable</a>
                        organizer, Malcolm X expressed the pent-up anger, frustration, 
                        and bitterness of African Americans 
                        during the major phase of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-civil-rights-movement">civil 
                        rights movement</a> from 1955 to 1965. 
                        He preached on the streets of Harlem 
                        and spoke at major universities such 
                        as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harvard-University">Harvard University</a> and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Oxford">University 
                        of Oxford</a>. His keen intellect, incisive 
                        wit, and <a data-term="ardent" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ardent">ardent</a>
                        radicalism made him a <a data-term="formidable" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formidable">formidable</a> critic of American society. 
                        He also criticized the mainstream civil 
                        rights movement, challenging <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-Luther-King-Jr">Martin 
                        Luther King, Jr</a>.’s central notions 
                        of <a data-term="integration" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integration">integration</a> and nonviolence. 
                        Malcolm argued that more was at stake 
                        than the civil right to sit in a restaurant 
                        or even to vote—the most important issues 
                        were Black identity, <a data-term="integrity" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity">integrity</a>, and 
                        independence. In contrast to King’s 
                        strategy of nonviolence, <a data-term="civil disobedience" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/civil-disobedience">civil disobedience</a>, 
                        and redemptive suffering, Malcolm urged 
                        his followers to defend themselves “by 
                        any means necessary.” His biting <a data-term="critique" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique">critique</a>
                        of the “so-called Negro” provided the

                        in the late 1960s and ’70s 
                        (see <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/black-nationalism">Black nationalism</a>). Through the 
                        influence of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X 
                        helped to change the terms used to refer to 
                        African Americans from “Negro” and “coloured” 
                        to “Black” and “Afro-American.”</p>

                        <h2>Final years and legacy</h2>
                        <p>In 1963 there were deep tensions 
                        between Malcolm and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elijah-Muhammad">Elijah Muhamma</a>
                        over the political direction of the Nation. 
                        Malcolm urged that the Nation become more 
                        active in the widespread <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/civil-rights">civil rights</a> 
                        protests instead of just being a critic 
                        on the sidelines. Muhammad’s violations 
                        of the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral">moral</a> 
                        code of the Nation further 
                        worsened his relations with Malcolm, 
                        who was devastated when he learned 
                        that Muhammad had fathered children 
                        by six of his personal secretaries, 
                        two of whom filed paternity suits and 
                        made the issue public. Malcolm brought 
                        additional bad publicity to the Nation 
                        when he declared publicly that Pres. 
                        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-F-Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>’s 
                        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/assassination">assination</a> 
                        was an example of “chickens coming home 
                        to roost”—a violent society suffering 
                        the consequences of violence. 
                        In response to the outrage this 
                        statement provoked, Elijah Muhammad 
                        ordered Malcolm to observe a 90-day 
                        period of silence, and the break 
                        between the two leaders became permanent.</p>

                        <p>Malcolm left the Nation in March 
                           1964 and in the next month founded 
                           Muslim Mosque, Inc. During his <a data-term="pilgrimage" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> 
                           to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mecca">Mecca</a> that same year, he experienced 
                           a second conversion and embraced <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam">Islam</a>, 
                           adopting the Muslim name el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. 
                           Renouncing the separatist beliefs of the Nation, 
                           he claimed that the solution to racial problems 
                           in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States">United States</a> lay in orthodox Islam. On 
                           the second of two visits to Africa in 1964, he 
                           addressed the Organization of African Unity 
                           (known as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/African-Union">frican Union</a> since 2002), 
                           an intergovernmental group established to promote 
                           African unity, international cooperation, and 
                           economic development. In 1965 he founded the 
                           <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Organization-of-Afro-American-Unity">Organization of Afro-American Unity</a> 
                           as a <a data-term="secular" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secular">secular</a> vehicle to internationalize the plight of Black 
                           Americans and to make common cause with the people 
                           of the developing world—to move from civil rights
                            to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-rights">human rights</a>.</p>

                            <p>The growing hostility between Malcolm and 
                              the Nation led to death threats and open violence
                               against him. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm was 
                               assassinated while delivering a lecture at the 
                               Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights. 
                               Three members of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nation-of-Islam">Nation of Islam</a> were 
                               arrested. During the trial, one of the suspects, 
                               Talmadge Hayer (also called Thomas Hagan; later 
                               known as Mujahid Abdul Halim), confessed but 
                               claimed the other two defendants—Norman 3X Butler 
                               (Muhammad Aziz) and Thomas 15X Johnson (Khalil Islam)—were 
                               not involved. Despite his testimony, all three men were 
                               convicted of the murder. Doubts over the guilt of Aziz
